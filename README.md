**Watch random strangers talk ðŸ˜‚**

#### How does this work?

A chart like such should explain:

### How do I run this?

First of all, don't forget to change the interests. Go into `index.coffee` and put in interests that you want your stranger to chat about.
```
  interests: ['Instagram', 'Snapchat', 'BTS']
```

After all do:
```
npm install coffee-script -g
npm install nodemon -g
git clone https://github.com/olegberman/mitm-omegle.git
cd mitm-omegle
npm install
nodemon index.coffee
```

### Enjoy
